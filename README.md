Description:
App which connects from Android to Raspberry Pi (or any another Linux device) to play music. Music is played with mpc (which is a command line media player for linux) on Raspberry. The connection to the Raspberry is made with SSH (Secure Shell).  The Smartphone works as a controller which sends weblinks to the RaspBerry Pi, the weblinks are added to a playlist and played from the internet on the pi.

At the first start the settings pop up. It's mandatory to give the correct ip and ssh-Port of your Raspberry Pi in the network then. Be sure to add username and password if you configured your SSH to use this.
